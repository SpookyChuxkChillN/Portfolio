CEIS101_5.ino
Setup: Initializes serial communication and sets pin modes.
Loop: Continuously measures distance using the ultrasonic sensor.
Distance Check:
If distance ≤ 6 inches: Turns on the red LED and buzzer.
If 6 < distance ≤ 12 inches: Turns on the yellow LED.
If distance > 12 inches: Turns on the green LED.
Buzzer Control: Adjusts the beeping rate based on the distance.
Serial Output: Prints the distance to the serial monitor if it’s less than 156 inches.

Automated Light: Turns on a light if the light sensor value is above 450.
Distance Sensor: Measures distance using an ultrasonic sensor.
Alert: If distance ≤ 6 inches, turns on the red LED and buzzer.
Warning: If 6 < distance ≤ 12 inches, turns on the yellow LED.
Safe: If distance > 12 inches, turns on the green LED.

This code monitors water levels, light intensity, and distance:
Water Sensor: Detects water levels and adjusts an LED’s brightness accordingly.
Automated Light: Turns on a light if the light sensor value is above 450.
Distance Sensor: Measures distance using an ultrasonic sensor.
Alert: If distance ≤ 6 inches, turns on the red LED and buzzer.
Warning: If 6 < distance ≤ 12 inches, turns on the yellow LED.
Safe: If distance > 12 inches, turns on the green LED.


CEIS101_6\CEIS101_6.1\CEIS101_4\CEIS101_4.ino
This code monitors a door sensor and controls LEDs and a buzzer based on the door’s state:
Door Closed: Turns on the green LED.
Door Open: Activates red and yellow LEDs, and the buzzer, indicating a security alert. The LEDs and buzzer blink with a delay.
It also prints a security alert message to the serial monitor when the door is open.


CEIS101_6\CEIS101_6.1\CEIS101_6.1\ArduinoCode.ino
This code controls an automated light and a distance sensor:
Automated Light: Turns on a light if the light sensor value is above 50.
Distance Sensor: Measures distance using an ultrasonic sensor.
Alert: If distance ≤ 6 inches, turns on the red LED and buzzer.
Warning: If 6 < distance ≤ 12 inches, turns on the yellow LED.
Safe: If distance > 12 inches, turns on the green LED.
It also prints relevant messages to the serial monitor.


CEIS101_6\CEIS101_6.1\CEIS101_6.2\CEIS101_6.2.ino
This code monitors water levels, light intensity, and distance:
